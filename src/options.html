    <p>If images fail to download due to a permissions error, you can add the
    permission by entering the hostname from the failed URL and pressing the
    <code>Request</code> button. Your browser will then ask you to approve the
    new permission.</p>

    <form method="post" id="md-permission-form">
        <label for="md-hostname">Hostname:</label>
        <input placeholder="name or *.name or *" name="hostname" id="md-hostname" type="text"
               maxlength="253" title="Hostname for which to request permission"
               pattern="\*|((\*\.|)[A-Za-z0-9][\-A-Za-z0-9]*(\.[A-Za-z0-9][\-A-Za-z0-9]*)*)"
               required />
        <button type="submit" title="Submit permission request">Request</button>
    </form>

    <p>Valid hostnames contain only letters (<code>a</code>-<code>z</code>),
    numbers (<code>0</code>-<code>9</code>), and hyphens (<code>-</code>), in
    groups separated by a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

    <table class="md-table">
        <caption>Added Host Permissions</caption>
        <tbody id="md-active-permissions" />
    </table>

    <p><b>NOTE</b>: If the download request was redirected to a different host
    by the website server, both the original hostname and the redirect
    destination hostname may need permission added. The failure notice will
    only list the original hostname and finding the redirect destination can
    be tricky.
    <span class="md-display-chrome">On Chrome (and similar) browsers, one way
    to find the redirect hostname is to open the Network tab of the Developer
    tools for this page and repeat the download attempt, but you should only
    do that if you understand what you're doing.</span>
    <span class="md-display-firefox">On Firefox browsers, this usually
    requires bringing up
    <a href="https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/#developer-tools-toolbox">the
    Developer Tools for the extension</a>, opening the Network tab, and then
    repeating the download attempt, but you should only do that if you
    understand what you're doing.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Do not include the scheme, path, or port number with the hostname. The
    hostname may optionally be prefixed with "<code>*.</code>" to also match
    any subdomain of a domain name. "<code>*</code>" by itself can also be
    used to match any hostname, but this is not recommended. For example, for
    the URL <code>https://www.example.com:8080/folder/image.png</code>, the
    hostnames <code>www.example.com</code>, <code>*.www.example.com</code>,
    <code>*.example.com</code>, and <code>*</code> will all match, but
    <code>example.com</code> will not.</p>
